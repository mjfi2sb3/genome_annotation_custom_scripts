# Repeat Masking a plant genome - Advanced -

Other than a few minor tweaks, this tutorial is based in its entirety on the advanced repeat masking tutorial outlined here:<br><br>

<br>If you wish to use the same script, you will need to pay attention to the fullpaths. I use the module management system to load/unload my software stack. You may wish to provide full path or add required programs to $PATH before they are called.

<br><br>
Here I provide a debugged version of the CRL scripts. The original scripts are available here http://www.hrt.msu.edu/uploads/535/78637/CRL_Scripts1.0.tar.gz
<br><br>
I also provide debugged ProtExcluder scripts. The original scripts are available at http://www.hrt.msu.edu/uploads/535/78637/ProtExcluder1.2.tar.gz and manual at http://www.hrt.msu.edu/uploads/535/78637/ProtExcluder1.2Manual.docx

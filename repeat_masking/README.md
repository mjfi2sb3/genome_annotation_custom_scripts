# Repeat Masking a plant genome - Advanced -

Other than a few minor tweaks, this tutorial is based in its entirety on the advanced repeat masking tutorial outlined here:<br><br>
http://weatherby.genetics.utah.edu/MAKER/wiki/index.php/Repeat_Library_Construction-Advanced 

<br>If you wish to use the same script, you will need to pay attention to the fullpaths. I use the module management system to load/unload my software stack. You may wish to provide full path or add required programs to $PATH before they are called.

<br><br>
Here I provide a debugged version of the CRL scripts. The original scripts are available here http://www.hrt.msu.edu/uploads/535/78637/CRL_Scripts1.0.tar.gz
<br><br>
I also provide debugged ProtExcluder scripts. The original scripts are available at http://www.hrt.msu.edu/uploads/535/78637/ProtExcluder1.2.tar.gz and manual at http://www.hrt.msu.edu/uploads/535/78637/ProtExcluder1.2Manual.docx

allRepeats.libnoProtFinal is the FINAL output of <i>de novo</i> repeat library as was generated by the pipeline for <i>S. pimpinellifolium</i>. The Tpase databases and plant.refseq.prexp201710 databases were rebuilt (Oct 2017) following the instructions from the tutorial (Files are too large to upload to github, will upload somewhere else and share asap).

<br><b>plant.refseq.prexp201710</b> <br>
plant.refseq.prexp201710 was built based on Plant_RefSeq plant which was tblastn-ed against NCBI-EST. All proteins that did not have a hit in NCBI-EST were discarded.
